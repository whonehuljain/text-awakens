Cloud-Based Data Modeling and Analysis Platform with Drag-and-Drop Interface and OpenAI API Integration for Simulation Insights

Our Success StoriesITClient BackgroundClient:A leading IT & tech firm in the USAIndustry Type:ITProducts & Services:IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaSOrganization Size:100+The ProblemCreate a cloud-based solution where clients can upload datasets, use drag-and-drop functionality to select columns for data modeling, and receive the analysis results. The data analysis will be conducted using the OpenAI API, except for the mixed model, which will be handled manually. Then later user can do the simulation to get the insight of the dataset.Our SolutionDevelop a web-based application using frameworks like React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Establish secure methods for database access and data handling. Initially, run statistical analyses using Python and update the interface with results including Mean AUC, Mean Accuracy, Mean Log-Likelihood, Coefficients with p-values, Intercept, BIC, AIC, Y_pred, Y_test, and X_test. Allow users to visualize the dataset with different charts, such as heatmaps, line charts, and actual vs. predicted values. Over time, automate these analyses by integrating Python scripts with the backend. Deploy the application on Google Cloud, ensuring the solution supports different user roles and permissions, with robust testing and scalable infrastructure. Provide features for users to perform simulations and gain insights based on the analysis results.DeliverablesData Analysis Integration:OpenAI API: Integration for performing statistical analyses.Python Scripts: Manual handling of mixed model analyses.Metrics and Results:Analysis results including Mean AUC, Mean Accuracy, Mean Log-Likelihood, Coefficients with p-values, Intercept, BIC, AIC, Y_pred, Y_test, and X_test.Data Visualization:Charts such as heatmaps, line charts, and actual vs. predicted values for dataset visualization.API Endpoints and Descriptions:Test APIPurpose:Fetch payload data and perform various data modeling tasks.Modeling Types:Logistic, ordinal, nominal, Poisson regression, multiple models, and mixed models.Details:This API retrieves the dataset from MongoDB, applies the specified statistical models, and returns the results.Data APIPurpose:Store the output from the Test API in MongoDB.Details:This API takes the modeling results from the Test API and stores them in a specified MongoDB collection for future reference and analysis.Remove APIPurpose:Delete stored outputs from MongoDB.Details:This API deletes specific records or datasets previously stored in MongoDB by the Data API based on provided criteria or identifiers.Mixed_Model_Identify APIPurpose:Identify datasets suitable for mixed model analysis.Details:This API analyzes the dataset to determine if it is appropriate for mixed model applications, identifying key variables and structure.Type_of_Column APIPurpose:Identify the types of columns in the dataset.Details:This API examines the dataset to determine the data types (e.g., categorical, ordinal, integer, real) of each column, which aids in data preprocessing and modeling decisions.Tech StackTools usedGoogle Cloud, VScode, MongoDBLanguage/techniques usedFlask framework, Python language, MongoDB as Database, OpenAI APIModels usedLogistic ModelPurpose:Binary classification (e.g., yes/no outcomes).Details:Predicts the probability of a binary response based on predictors.Ordinal logistic ModelPurpose:Ordinal outcome variables (e.g., ratings).Details:Models outcomes with a defined order but unknown distances.Nominal logistic ModelPurpose:Categorical outcomes without order (e.g., types).Details:Models categorical responses with no inherent order.Poisson regression ModelPurpose:Count data modeling (e.g., event occurrences).Details:Models the count of events within a fixed interval.Multiple regression ModelPurpose:Multiple linear regression.Details:Predicts a continuous outcome using multiple predictors.Mixed ModelPurpose:Hierarchical or grouped data.Details:Combines fixed and random effects for multi-level data.Cox ModelPurpose:Survival analysis with time-to-event data.Details:Models hazard rates over time.Survival ModelPurpose:Analyzes time until events occur.Details:Focuses on time-to-event data such as survival times.Skills usedPrompt engineering, flask, data modelling.Databases usedMongoDBWeb Cloud Servers usedGoogle CloudWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution1-Generating R-code through ChatGPT and Executing it in the Back-end:Integrating R-cloud services with the backend is complex. It involves setting up secure connections and ensuring compatibility with the existing infrastructure.2-Prompt Engineering:ChatGPT often struggles to generate complex code that meets specific client requirements. Refining prompts to improve code quality requires significant trial and error.3-Mixed Model Handling:Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of mixed models, using prompt engineering or manual methods is challenging. This often requires expert intervention to ensure accuracy.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedSwitching from R to Python:We replaced R with Python and executed scripts on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which provided better compatibility, stability, and ease of managing dependencies.Improved Prompt Engineering:To ensure ChatGPT generated accurate code, we provided specific code snippets as templates for each task. This guided the AI and improved the quality and consistency of the generated code.Handling Mixed Models:We combined manual intervention with automated checks to manage the complexity of mixed models. Although initial results sometimes required corrections, iterative testing and refinement helped improve accuracy.Business ImpactThis is mainly used for healthcare field for data analysis enhancing decision-making efficiency and accuracy for users.Project website urlhttps://test.aidprofit.comSummarizeSummarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.Contact DetailsThis solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
