Department-Wise KPI Tracking Dashboard with Technician Performance Analysis for AtoZ Dependable Service

Our Success StoriesRetail & Supply ChainClient BackgroundClient:A leading retail tech firm in the USAIndustry Type:RetailProducts & Services:Retail BusinessesOrganization Size:100+The ProblemThe organization has some services like sales, installs and services for many departments like drain, plumbing, excavation, hvac and bath. Organization wants to track some KPIs based on the given monthly target and tracking should be department wise or technician wise. The dashboard will show tracking the pace of KPIs so that they can understand how the organization is performing in each department in terms of number of jobs, revenue etc and also they want to understand  how technicians are working to achieve their monthly target. Dashboard has two basic views – one for admin persons and one for users only. When an admin person logged in to the web app he will see the dashboard as an iframe and he can filter date range, department, technician to see the progress of department and technicians. When a user logged in to the web app he will see the user dashboard view after  auto-filtering his name so that he can only view his data in the dashboard.Scope of this project is limited to AtoZ Dependable Service but scaleable to auto user filter in dashboard datasource. Each user will see his data only in the dashboard that brings data security and integrity.Our SolutionDefine attributes and entities that needed to determine all the KPIs for trackingGroup KPIs in categories and subcategories. For example- as per work defined in organization can be divided into three main categories called Service, Sales and Install. And each of these categories can be divided into 5 departments called- Drain, BATH, HVAC, plumbing and excavation. So any department will have the same KPIs for the same  category.

In admin create three pages Service, Sales and Install. For users create 3 separate dashboard each belongs to one of the main categoryAdd datasource for each of the main categories- Service, sales and install, assign these datasource to the correct page. Same data source will be reused in users dashboardDetermine what type of charts needed to full fill the client requirement, add them and configure accordinglyCreate embedded URL and provide those to the developer team to use as iframe in the primary product www.atozscoreboard.com.Create a user filter parameter (default- params) for the user dashboard and make this as json string and pass it to the embed url through back-end code. So when a user will log in to the web app they will see a filtered dashboard which will only show his filter data from data sourceDeliverables>> Front-end component –Login pageSignup PageChange passwordHomepage (Login User) – User DashboardHomepage (Admin) – Admin DashboardAdd Actual forms – Install Actual, Sales Actual, Service ActualAdd Target forms – Install Target, Sales Target, Service TargetList View – Install Actual, Sales Actual, Service ActualList View –  Install Target, Sales Target, Service Target>>Back-end components (in main/views.py)Login ViewSignup ViewChange Password ViewReset Password By Email View (Email service needed)Install CreateView (UpdateView DeleteView implemented but not used)Sales CreateView (UpdateView DeleteView implemented but not used)Service CreateView (UpdateView DeleteView implemented but not used)Install Target CreateView Updateview DeleteViewSalesTarget CreateView Updateview DeleteViewServiceTarget CreateView Updateview DeleteViewSTATIC_FOLDER in VM = ‘/demo/www/public/web_app’Tech StackTools usedDjango3.2,  LookerStudioLanguage/techniques usedPython, Html5, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap4Skills usedData visualisation, Database Optimized Queries, Form Validations, Tracking AlgorithmsDatabases usedPostgreSQLWeb Cloud Servers usedLinode VMWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionAdmin Dashboard:Overview: Provides an overall view of the monthly performance of all departments.Tracking: Allows admins to track the progress and performance of individual employees within each department.Analytics: Offers detailed analytics and reports on departmental and employee performance metrics.Employee Dashboard:Goals and Targets: Displays specific goals and targets for employees to achieve.Performance Tracking: Enables employees to monitor their progress towards their goals.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedDashboard has two basic views – one for admin persons and one for users only.
