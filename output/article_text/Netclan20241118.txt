Real-time dashboard to monitor infrastructure activity and Machines

Our Success StoriesInfrastructure & Real EstateITClient BackgroundClient:A leading tech firm in EuropeIndustry Type:ITServices:Software ServicesOrganization Size:30+Project ObjectiveFor the current project, we hope to develop a real-time dashboard (* it updates every several minutes). Currently, we have multiple Ubuntu machines that are sending messages every minute to Apache Pulsar.Project DescriptionDeveloping a realtime updating dashboard to display the metadata of various machines on a server from pandio queue.The dahboard must display the count of “inactive” , “active” and “down” servers with a table displaying the details of all the machines in different color scheme for each type of server/machine.Our SolutionWe used Django framework to develop the dashboard as it didn’t require the ec2 instance to be active on machine which was the problem with using streamlit.For communication between webpage and fetched data we used django channel .We used django background task module to make the fetching run forever in background.Project DeliverablesReal time updating Dashboard with separate color scheme for different types of machines.Storing the historical data in sqlite3 db.Tools usedDjangoWeb ChannelsD3 jsReddis serverSkills usedPythonDjango FrameworkDjango web channelsHTML/CSS + JSDatabases usedDjango sqlite3 database.Web Cloud Servers usedAWSWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionMaking the dashboard run forever using streamlitData updation in realtime when using django channelsHow the Technical Challenges were SolvedSwitched the entire dashboard to django frameworkWe redirected data to channels on local reddis server.Project SnapshotsProject website urlDevelopment hosted URL
