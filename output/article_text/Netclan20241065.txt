Analytical solution for a tech firm

Our Success StoriesITClient BackgroundClient:A leading tech firm in the USAIndustry Type:ITServices:ConsultingOrganization Size:100+The ProblemThe client’s organization had a project that matches URLs up using TF-IDF algorithm.The script threw some errors and resolving these errors was the immediate ask.The client also required us to adjust the script for better accuracy and faster computation.Our SolutionR&D on the code developedFind & List bugsSolve the BugsFind and get the best matching algorithm implemented.Check and compare the existing matching algorithm implemented for accuracy.if not check of other solution – ngrams or fuzzy logicMeet the expected outputDeliverablesFully functional codeSolution & DocumentationSupportTools usedGoogle spreadsheetsMicrosoft ExcelGoogle ColaboratoryLanguage/techniquesPythonModels usedTF-IDFBERTNgramsFlair EmbeddingsRapid FuzzSkills usedProblem-solvingCommunicationData ModellingData PipeliningPython CodingDatabases usedGoogle spreadsheetsWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionBugs on the model used by the client was fairly competent using pretrained librariesThe accuracy for the bug free code on the models used by the client was shaen once the model ran on a different set of data inputHow the Technical Challenges were SolvedA vanilla code to execute the same logic while fine tuning the matching algorithm was written in order to over come the shortcomings of the pretrained model bugsThe data pre-processing was done manually in order to transform every instance of an input into better readable format to be able to go into the model and get best matching accuracy possible in the given timeframe of execution of the codeBusiness ImpactHelped the client to perform the matching process with maximum accuracy and lowest cost on code, by implementing manually written vanilla code from scratch to utilise the matching algorithm.Project SnapshotsProject website urlhttps://colab.research.google.com/github/AjayBidyarthy/Daniel-Emery/blob/main/vanilla.ipynb#scrollTo=vPp14xj020RLContact DetailsHere are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyFor project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
