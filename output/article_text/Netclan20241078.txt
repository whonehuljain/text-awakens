Advanced AI for Pedestrian Crossing Safety

Our Success StoriesInfrastructure & Real EstateProduction & manufacturingClient BackgroundClient:A leading tech firm in the Middle EastIndustry Type:SecurityServices:Security servicesOrganization Size:100+The ProblemTraffic Signals are inefficient because even if there are no cars or no pedestrians on the road it still works on a timer and stops the traffic or pedestrian unnecessarily.Our SolutionWe provide a Computer vision-logic to Manipulate the traffic signal to work such that it turns red only when x number of pedestrians are waiting to cross the signal.Solution ArchitectureYolov7 pose estimationOpencvDeliverablesThe program Detects Pedestrians and Gives alerts to traffic Signals to turn Red or stay Green.Yolov7 pose model weightsTools usedYolov7OpencvLanguage/techniques usedPythonComputer VisionModels usedYolov7 Pose EstimationSkills usedProgrammingComputer VisionDeep LearningWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThere was no existing solution and we had to create the logic from scratch.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedResearching Computer Vision.
