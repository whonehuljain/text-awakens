This library allows you to detect grammar errors and spelling mistakes through a Python script or through a command-line interface.Sentimental Analysis: For Sentimental Analysis we used FLAIR, Flair is a pre-trained embedding-based model. This means that each word is represented inside a vector space. Words with vector representations most similar to another word are often used in the same context. This allows us, to, therefore, determine the sentiment of any given vector, and therefore, any given sentence.Keywords Extraction:For keywords extraction we usedSPACYwhich is newer than NLTK or Scikit-Learn, is aimed at making deep learning for text data analysis as simple as possible. The following are the procedures involved in extracting keywords from a text using spacy.Split the input text content by tokensExtract the hot words from the token list.Set the hot words as the words with pos tag “PROPN“, “ADJ“, or “NOUN“. (POS tag list is customizable)Find the most common T number of hot words from the listSolution ArchitectureDeliverablesCommentScoringAPI that will take comments/reviews as input, and do the textual analysis on the given comment and will return the Comment Score based on counts of spell and grammar errors, sentiments, hot keywords.Tools usedNumpy,pandas,flask,NLTK,Spacy(Keyword Extraction),language tool python(spell and grammar check),flair(Sentimental Analysis)Language/techniques usedPythonBusiness ImpactClient have a user schema that contain all the information of users that have visited there platform, and he/she want to build a Script that will take all the reviews of a certain User as input and than will do textual analysis on all the comments of the user , by textual analysis we mean Spell and Grammar Check, Sentimental Analysis, and Keywords extraction.
